# Album 9 Song 1 உத்தமனாய் உமக்குமுன்பு நடந்திடுவேன் - I Will Walk Upright Before You

This song of upright walking and integrity echoes Psalm 15 — who shall dwell on Your holy hill? The one who walks blamelessly, speaks truth, honors the godly, and takes no bribe. It is a prayer for holy living in the presence of God. In the eternal day, this uprightness is perfected — we dwell forever in His holy hill, the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:3).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Holy High Priest who walked blameless before the Father,
thank You for calling us to walk uprightly in Your presence.
Cleanse our lips, our hands, our hearts.
Make us dwell in Your tent and ascend Your holy hill.
In the eternal day, let us live blameless forever before Your throne.
Come quickly, righteous Judge.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
