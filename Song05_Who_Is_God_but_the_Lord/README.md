# Who Is God but the Lord? - கர்த்தரையல்லாமல் தேவன் யார்?

This triumphant declaration echoes Psalm 18:31 and 2 Samuel 22:32 — “Who is God, but the Lord?” It proclaims Jesus as Alpha and Omega, Way, Truth, Life, and Deliverer. In the eternal day, this confession is universal — every knee bows, every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord (Philippians 2:10–11).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Alpha and Omega, Way, Truth, and Life,
thank You for being the only God and Savior.
Gird us with strength, make our paths straight, avenge our cause.
In the eternal day, let every tongue confess You alone.
Come quickly, exalted King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
