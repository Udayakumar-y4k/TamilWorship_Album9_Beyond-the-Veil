# My Steps Shall Not Falter - என் காலடிகள் வழுவாதைய்யா

This song of steadfast walking and trust echoes Psalm 37:23–24 and Psalm 119:133 — the Lord establishes our steps and keeps them from stumbling. It is a declaration of dependence on God’s Word and grace for uprightness. In the eternal day, this walking becomes perfect — no faltering, no stumbling, only walking in His light forever (Revelation 21:23–25).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who establishes our steps and keeps us from falling,
thank You for guiding us by Your Word and grace.
Let our feet not falter, our path be straight.
In the eternal day, let us walk in Your uncreated light forever.
Come quickly, our Guide and Strength.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
