# Beyond the Veil – Pure Worship in the Holy of Holies
(மறைப்பிற்கு அப்பால் – பரிசுத்த இடத்தின் தூய ஆராதனை)
This album draws the remnant deeper — beyond the veil, into the Holy of Holies, where Jesus Christ, our High Priest, has entered once for all with His own blood (Hebrews 9:11–12; 10:19–22).
Quiet, intimate, reverent — bowed hearts, lifted hands, the sound of His name alone.
