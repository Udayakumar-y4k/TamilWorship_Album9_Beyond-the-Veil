# Sweeter Than Honey, the Word of the Lord - தேன் கூட்டிலிருந்து தெளிவான தேன் ஒழுகுதே

This song of delight in God’s Word echoes Psalm 19 — the heavens declare His glory, but His law is perfect, reviving the soul, sweeter than honey. It is a prayer for purity and forgiveness through His Word. In the eternal day, this sweetness is perfected — we feast on the tree of life, His Word forever on our lips (Revelation 22:1–2).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, living Word sweeter than honey,
thank You for Your perfect law that revives the soul.
Let Your Word be our delight, Your fear our treasure.
Forgive hidden faults, keep us from willful sin.
In the eternal day, let us feast on Your Word forever.
Come quickly, our Joy and our Light.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
